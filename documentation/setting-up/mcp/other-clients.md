> ## Agent Instructions
> fal has two developer products. Model APIs run hosted models through an API key. fal Serverless deploys your own Python apps and models on fal GPUs.
> To call a hosted model, start with the [Quick Start](../../quickstart.md) and the [Model APIs overview](../../model-apis/overview.md).
> To deploy your own model with fal Serverless, start with these pages:
> - [Introduction to Serverless](../../serverless.md): What fal Serverless is and the three ways to deploy on it.
> - [Installation & Setup](../../development/getting-started/installation.md): Install the fal CLI with `pip install fal` and authenticate.
> - [Quick Start](../../development/getting-started/quick-start.md): Build a Hello World app, test it with `fal run`, and ship it with `fal deploy`.
> - [App Lifecycle](../../development/app-lifecycle.md): How a `fal.App` goes from code to running runners.
> - [Define Your Endpoints](../../development/endpoints-overview.md): Structure the API endpoints that your app exposes.
> - [Deploy to Production](../../deployment/deploy-to-production.md): Persistent URLs, authentication modes, and automatic scaling.
> - [Machine Types](../../deployment/machine-types.md): Available GPU and CPU machine types and how to choose one.
> - [Pricing](../../serverless/pricing.md): Per-second billing and the runner states that are billed.
> - [Scaling Parameter Reference](../../deployment/scale-your-application.md): Parameters that control runners, concurrency, and scale to zero.
> - [Optimizing Cold Starts](../../serverless/optimizations/optimize-cold-starts.md): Causes of cold starts and ways to make them shorter.
> - [Examples](../../../examples.md): Complete Serverless apps for image, video, audio, 3D, realtime, and multi-GPU workloads.
> - [Migrating to fal](../../development/migrating-to-fal.md): Guides to move an existing Docker server or an app from another platform to fal.
> fal Serverless deploys need access that the fal team approves for each account. Request access at https://fal.ai/dashboard/serverless-get-started.

# MCP setup for other clients

> Connect any compatible MCP client to fal using Streamable HTTP and OAuth.

Connect any compatible MCP client to fal using Streamable HTTP and OAuth.

> [!TIP]
>
> To add fal to all supported agents on your computer at once, run the installer. See [Coding agents: one command](../mcp.md#coding-agents-one-command).
>
> ```bash theme={null}
> curl -fsSL https://fal.ai/mcp/install.sh | bash
> ```

## Setup

**1. Add the server URL**

Open your tool's MCP settings and add a remote server named `fal`. Paste `https://mcp.fal.ai/mcp-relay`. Select **Streamable HTTP** and **OAuth** if your tool asks.

**2. Sign in**

Connect the server, complete browser sign-in, and return to your tool.

**3. Check tools**

Ask your tool to find a fal model without running it. If tools are unavailable, restart your session.

Your client must support remote Streamable HTTP and OAuth. Setup labels vary between clients. Follow your client's documentation for its exact configuration format.

## Next steps

After connecting, [try your first generation](../mcp.md#try-your-first-generation). For account selection, tools, and troubleshooting, see the [fal MCP overview](../mcp.md).
